# How To run the Publisher
Use your favorit IDE and lanch the program, or use a shell or cmd, navigate to the folder and run the command:
```bash
dotnet run
```

Now you can use the Swagger UI to send messages to the publisher. Or use the browser with the url http://localhost:5106/SendDirectMessage?message=Hello (you can change the message parameter to whatever you want).  

You can also use a API test tool like Postman or SoapUI. Please refer to those tools documentation to learn how to use them.
